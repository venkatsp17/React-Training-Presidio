# Dynamic Item Manager

Welcome to the Dynamic Item Manager project! This project demonstrates the use of various React Hooks to manage a list of items dynamically.

## Features

- **Add Item**: Implement functionality to add new items with a name and description.
- **Remove Item**: Enable removal of items from the list.
- **Sort Items**: Implement sorting options for items by name or description.
- **Filter Items**: Create a filtering mechanism based on a search term.
- **Persist State**: Ensure the state persists across renders and updates.

## React Hooks Usage

- **useReducer**: Manage the list of items with actions for adding and removing.
- **useContext**: Provide and consume item state through a context and provider.
- **useState**: Manage local state for form fields, search term, and sorting option.
- **useEffect**: Log updates whenever the item list changes.
- **useRef**: Automatically focus the search input field upon initial render.
- **useLayoutEffect**: Ensure layout adjustments (like focusing the input) happen before the screen is painted.
- **Custom Hooks**: Create a custom hook to encapsulate filtering and sorting logic based on user input.

### Custom Hooks Used

- **useDebounce**
- **useSort**
